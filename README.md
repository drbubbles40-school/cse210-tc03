CSE 210 
This repository is for the group projects of Team 2 
in BYUI's Programming with Classes. Our first thing of note
is to create BIO branches which I will then add to the main repository.
I won't be there for the team meeting this week, so if it is easier for you 
all to have someone else be the leader for organization purposes feel free.
However, I will do my best and have made this repository for us to use otherwise.
So keep me updated via slack and I will do my best to swiftly review and update the repo!
Should be back in town next week and things will be smoother on my end. Thanks for bearing 
with me.
